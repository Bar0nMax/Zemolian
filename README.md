GUI for ZCash Cloud Miners

I created this project so the beginners and non technical miners can get started with ZCash mining in Windows.

I used http://zcash.flypool.org/ as an example for pool mining.

The CPU miner referenced can be found here:  https://github.com/Genoil/ZECMiner

The GPU miner referenced and can be found here: https://github.com/etherchain-org/nheqminer

This is just a tool that will generate and run a batch file using the above referenced miners.

Instructions:

Select a Type:  CPU or GPU miner
Connection:  miner address
Wallet: t or z wallet id
Port: port to connect in your miner address
Threads:  number of threads to run
User: username for pool you connect to
Password:  password for the pool you connect to
Command:  This is the complete command line that gets generated and run when you press Go
Go!: Start mining using your selected type!

I hope that somebody finds this useful.  

Good luck and happy mining!
